## About The Project

Where will the rails take you next?

This project is a digital experience designed for the spontaneous traveler. Inspired by the Dcard show "電車吃漢" and the simple joy of an unplanned journey, this application randomly selects a train station from Taiwan's extensive railway network to be your next destination.

The experience focuses on a clean, minimalist design with smooth animations, culminating in a unique, beautifully crafted ticket that you can download and share to commemorate the start of your new adventure.
